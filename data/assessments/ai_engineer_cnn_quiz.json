      "question": "Compare and contrast Max Pooling and Average Pooling layers. Describe their primary purpose in a CNN and provide a scenario where Max Pooling might be preferred over Average Pooling.",

    {
      "id": "ae_q_003",
      "question": "After extracting features through convolutional and pooling layers, CNNs typically transition to 'Flatten' and 'Fully Connected' (Dense) layers. Explain the role of both the Flatten layer and the subsequent Fully Connected layers in preparing the features for final classification.",

    {
      "id": "ae_q_004",
      "question": "Describe the concept of feature learning in CNNs. How does the hierarchical nature of CNNs contribute to the automatic extraction of features from images, and why is this beneficial compared to traditional feature engineering?",

    {
      "id": "ae_q_005",
      "question": "Discuss the significance of activation functions, particularly the Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU), in CNNs. Why is ReLU commonly used, and what advantages does it offer over other activation functions?",
